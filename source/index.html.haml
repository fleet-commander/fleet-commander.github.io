        on a large scale we realized there was a clear gap in the tools we offered sysadmins. Fleet Commander builds on existing Red Hat lead development efforts such as the

        administration tools and the

        suite of LDAP tools. With the help of Fleet Commander you should be able to administer hundreds or thousands of Linux desktops with ease.

          Fleet Commander requires a FreeIPA or Active Directory service to work with and to store the desktop profiles.
        %p
          Fleet Commander consists of three components:
        %ul
          %li
            The Fleet Commander Admin, a cockpit plugin and a service that manages all the desktop profiles in FreeIPA or Active Directory servers.
          %li
            The Fleet Commander Logger. Installed on your template VMs to set up the profiles realtime from Fleet Commander Admin Live Session.
          %li
            The Fleet Commander Client, a client side service that runs on every host of the network and that applies the desktop profiles when the user logs in.
        %p
          Fleet Commander uses libvirt and KVM to run a virtual desktop session that allows the user to live edit the configuration of the applications on a template system that resembles the client setup.
